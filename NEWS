40.beta
-------

* Completing GNOME Initial Setup no longer triggers GNOME Tour. GNOME Shell 40
  now prompts new and upgrading users to run the tour. (#120)

* Previous versions of Initial Setup would run the first time a user logs in
  ("existing user" mode) as well as when the system is booted with no users
  ("new user" mode). Initial Setup no longer displays any UI in "existing user"
  mode, to avoid colliding with the tour. The mode has not been removed in code
  – a simple check has been added to the main() function. If your distribution
  needs the old behaviour, this check can be patched out. The hope is that a
  future version of GNOME will restore "existing user" mode, but run Initial
  Setup from the same cut-down Shell that is used in "new user" mode. (#120)

* Initial Setup's .desktop file is now installed to @datadir@/applications
  (i.e. /usr/share/applications) rather than a GDM-specific directory. This
  means its icon is displayed correctly when run within a normal shell session.
  Some distros have previously worked around this issue by installing a
  symbolic link. (The astute reader may note that this is a no-op given the
  previous bullet point, but it is still a nice clean-up.) (#52)

* Translation updates:
 - Panjabi

40.alpha
--------

* Some enhancements to the avatar picker:
  - The "Take a photo…" button now has the suggested-action style. (!97)

  refreshed splash image.

3.38.1
------

* #110 / !104: Fix the window sometimes opens at an unusably small size, rather
  than being sized appropriately for the display. The fix causes a regression
  where the window doesn't react to the display size changing in all cases
  (#112) but the new behaviour is better than the old.

* Other bugs fixed:
 - !102 docs: Remove typo from DEBUGGING.md
 - !103 Misc use-after-free and critical warning fixes

-------

* Revamp the ‘welcome’ screen. See #7 for more details and screenshots.

* Bugs fixed:
 - #7 Nicer welcome page

3.37.90
-------

* Use `gnome-tour` instead of `yelp` to start the welcome tour. (MR !90.)

* Switch to a new user session management approach of defining the session
  services in `gnome-session@gnome-initial-setup.target.d/session.conf` in the
  systemd user unit directory. This bumps the optional systemd dependency
  to ≥ 242. See !66 for more details.

* Bugs fixed:
 - !66 Systemd unit update for 3.38
 - !90 welcome tour: replace yelp with gnome-tour

3.37.3
------

* The avatars offered in the 'account' page can now be customized by setting
  the 'org.gnome.desktop.interface avatar-directories' GSetting, which also
  controls the avatars offered in Settings. (This introduces a dependency on
  gsettings-desktop-schemas ≥ 3.37.1.)

* Since version 3.30, it has been possible to customize certain aspects of
  Initial Setup by specifing the 'vendor-conf-file' option at build time, then
  installing a configuration file to that path. This version adds two paths
  that will be checked by default: one for distribution configuration, and
  another to override that configuration on specific deployments.

  If you specify the 'vendor-conf-file' at build time, the old behaviour is
  preserved and the new paths will not be searched. If possible, please migrate
  any existing configuration to the new path, and stop specifying the
  build-time option.

* Bugs fixed:
  - #106 timezone: Don't set timezone if tz page is skipped
 - #75 Polkit rules seem to list now unneeded privileges
 - #95 Add error argument to save_data() vfunc
 - #104 Japanese (Kana Kanji) no longer the default input method for Japanese in 3.36.2
 - #105 Reconsider installation location of vendor.conf
 - #106 gnome-initial-setup tries to set timezone even though timezone page is disabled
 - !60 account: Use facesdirs setting to override faces
 - !84 Fix pkgdata_dir location

* Bugs fixed:
 - !82 keyboard: Nullify pointers if getting layout fails

* Translation updates:
 - Hebrew
 - Kurdish, Central
 - Slovak

3.36.1
------

* Previous releases of gnome-initial-setup had an unversioned dependency on
  libsecret; this release requires libsecret ≥ 0.18.8.  (libsecret 0.18.8 was
  released as part of GNOME 3.32; GNOME 3.36 includes libsecret 0.20.1.)

* Bugs fixed:
 - !78 account: Make parent account usable in case of errors
 - !79 Improve readability when removing event sources
 - !80 Fix two crashes when saving parental controls settings
 - !81 Use g_auto and g_autoptr more

3.35.91
-------

* New pages have been added to set up parental controls for the new user
  account. They are shown (or not, by default) based on a checkbox on the
  (local) user creation page. This feature requires malcontent ≥ 0.5.0
  <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pwithnall/malcontent/> and complements
  parental controls support already present in Flatpak and GNOME Software. If
  disabled or if that dependency is not available, no new UI is introduced
  compared to 3.35.90.

* When running under JHBuild, gnome-keyring is left untouched, and state is not
  saved when setup is complete. This heuristic is intended to make testing the
  application during development easier.

* GLib ≥ 2.63.1 is now required.

* Fixed various memory leaks, warnings, and a memory safety bug.

3.35.90
-------

* The final page has been revamped, with minor typography tweaks to other pages
  (#8).

* The timezone map was updated.

* Three pages have been removed since they were unused in all known
  configurations:

  - the region page, which has not displayed even if enabled for many years
    (#90)
  - the software page, which has not displayed for several releases due to
    changes in GNOME Software (#59)
  - the eulas page (!71, #72)

  file (!63)

0.2
===

 * Add a language selector to replace the Welcome splash screen
   before.
 * GDM integration has been rewritten to use libgdm instead of
   libgdmuser.
 * A lot of code has been properly split out into static
   libraries; each page now has one static library. In the
   future, we will have an unsupported module API that can be
   used to extend the system.
 * Use a cc-notebook, stolen from gnome-control-center, that
   allows smooth animations between pages. A plain GTK+
   implementation is being written for systems without the
   capabilities to run animations.
 * Complete integration by including a copy worker run on session
   init. This strategy should work for the use case of enterprise
   users.
 * Fix libcheese integration, and disallow the file picker when
   choosing a user icon.
