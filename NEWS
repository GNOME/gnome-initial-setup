   (#174)

Bug fixes:

 - Double-clicking on the headerbar no longer makes the window super small.
   (#136)
 - The keyboard layout list is no longer empty until you search or expand it.
   (#165)
 - Non-ASCII characters in location names are now displayed correctly on the
   timezone page. Previously, changing the language on the first page would
   cause them to be mangled. (#177)
 - StartupWMClass is now set in the .desktop file, allowing GNOME Shell to
   associate the app window with the desktop file. (!187)

44.beta
-------

* Correctly align the 'Preview' links on the keyboard page. (#150, Automeris
  naranja)

* Update for removal of WebKitGTK sandbox API in 2.39.5. (!177, Michael Catanzaro)

* Update password page to Adwaita style. (!178, Cassidy James Blaede)

44.alpha.2
----------

* Unlike 44.alpha.1, this version really can be built against the new
  webkitgtk-6.0 API from WebKitGTK 2.39.1, as well as webkit2gtk-5.0.
  (Michael Catanzaro)

* The close button on the "Failed to join domain" dialog now works. (#161)

* The quick settings menu is now correctly shown in the Initial Setup session.
  (!166)

* The search fields on the keyboard layout and timezone pages now have
  placeholder text, as recommended by the GNOME HIG. Thanks to sunflowerskater
  for their first contribution to this project! (#144)

* Translation updates:
 - Abkhazian

44.alpha.1
----------

This is an early release to support building against the new webkitgtk-6.0 API
from WebKitGTK 2.39.1, or webkit2gtk-5.0 as before. (!164)

There are no other changes compared to the GNOME 43 branch.

43.rc.1

  to GTK 4; in this release, its buttons are accessible once again, and its
  appearance improved. (#152)

* Translation updates:

43.rc
-----

* Initial Setup no longer crashes if you attempt to use capital letters or
  periods in your username on systems that reject such usernames. Instead,
  it always forbids capital letters and periods in usernames. (#117, !30,
  thanks to Xiang Fan)

* Several regressions in the timezone page were fixed, including selecting a
  timezone by typing the name of a city and picking a location from
  the dropdown (#145, !157, Georges Stavracas) and searching for locations not
  found in the gweather database (!158).

* Page-skipping works again (!156, Adam Williamson)

* Parental Controls support now correctly requires malcontent 0.11.0's new API
  name. Beware: if libostree or libflatpak are built against libsoup2.4, then
  linking Initial Setup to libmalcontent for parental controls support will
  cause it to abort on startup, since Initial Setup also links to webkit2gtk5
  which requires libsoup3.

43.beta
-------

* Initial Setup has been ported to GTK 4, libadwaita, and friends, thanks to
  Georges Stavracas. As a result:

  - libnma-gtk4 is now required, rather than libnma.

  - GTK 4 is required in addition to GTK 3. This is because goa-backend does
    not have a GTK 4 port. Like in gnome-control-center, the use of goa-backend
    is split out into a separate process.

  - webkit2gtk5 is now required. (However, goa-backend brings a transitive
    dependency on webkit2gtk4.)

  - Since webkit2gtk5 requires libsoup 3, the soup2=true configuration option
    has been removed. Initial Setup depends on geocode-glib-2.0, and versions
    of librest and gweather4 built against libsoup 3.

  - Support for taking a selfie as your account avatar has been removed, since
    libcheese-gtk lacks a GTK 4 port, and the optional libcheese[-gtk]
    dependency is no more.

  - Parental controls support requires malcontent 0.11 which is not released
    at the time of writing.

  There is a known regression from the port: selecting a timezone by typing the
  name of a city and picking a location from the dropdown does not work. To
  work around this, click a location on the map to select a timezone. This is
  tracked as https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-initial-setup/-/issues/145
  and will be addressed in a future release.

* When systemd support is enabled, Initial Setup now installs a sysusers.d
  snippet for its user, thanks to David King.

43.alpha.1
----------

* When built with -Dsoup2=false (the default), Initial Setup now depends on
  geocode-glib-2.0, introduced in geocode-glib 3.26.3 as a parallel-installable,
  soup3-flavoured version of the library. When built with -Dsoup2=true, Initial
  Setup continues to depend on geocode-glib-1.0.

* Initial Setup's build system tries to detect when its dependencies are built
  against an incompatible libsoup, but there is one known case that is not
  detected at build time. If Initial Setup is built with parental controls
  enabled, the malcontent parental controls library brings with it a dependency
  on libflatpak and libostree. Neither of these libraries can currently be built
  against libsoup3. Either they must be built against  libcurl rather than
  libsoup; or Initial Setup must be built with -Dsoup2=true; or Initial Setup
  must be built with -Dparental_controls=disabled; or Initial Setup will abort
  on startup.

43.alpha
--------

* Initial Setup now builds against rest-1.0 if available, falling back to
  rest-0.7 if not. There is no meson option to control this.

* Initial Setup now builds against libsoup 3 by default. As a transitional
  measure, you can opt to build against libsoup 2 by passing -Dsoup2=true
  to meson setup. geocode-glib-1.0, gweather4, and rest (1.0 or 0.7) must
  have been built against the same version of libsoup.

* A number of Meson .wrap files for dependencies such as gweather4 have been
  removed. These dependencies are now widely available in stable distros and
  container images thereof.

* Initial Setup no longer reads gnome-version.xml to determine the GNOME
  version in the fallback case when no OS information is available from
  /etc/os-release. gnome-version.xml has been removed from GNOME 43.

42.0.1
------

* The dark theme preference support introduced in 42.rc caused a regression in
  Initial Setup's handling of the login keyring. The effect was that the new
  user's login keyring password does not match their system password, and so
  cannot be unlocked. This regression is fixed in this release. Thanks to Adam
  Williamson for diagnosing the problem & Matthias Clasen for suggesting the
  fix. (#141)

42.rc
-----

* Initial Setup now supports the GNOME 42 dark theme preference, and picks up a
  dependency on libhandy to enable this. This will only have a visible impact
  if a distribution overrides the default value of this preference, since there
  is no way for a user to adjust this preference until Initial Setup is
  complete. (Jeremy Bicha, !140)

* Translation updates:
 - Portuguese (Brazil)

42.alpha
----

* Initial Setup now depends on libgweather-4 and gnome-desktop-4, rather than
  their predecessors. Meson wrap files are provided in case these dependencies
  are not available.

* The third-party software sources page has been tweaked to more accurately
  describe what the switch does, and to replace the switch with a
  suggested-action toggle button. (This page is currently Fedora-specific;
  patches welcome!)

* The COPYING file has been clarified to contain only a copy of GPL version 2.
  Previously it also contained a copy of LGPL version 2 (not 2.1). There is no
  change to the actual licensing of GNOME Initial Setup: as before, it is
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or
  later.

* The summary page widget tree has been simplified, with no visual change.

* Some Meson deprecation warnings have been addressed. Meson 0.53.0 or newer is
  now required to build Initial Setup.

40.beta
-------

* Completing GNOME Initial Setup no longer triggers GNOME Tour. GNOME Shell 40
  now prompts new and upgrading users to run the tour. (#120)

* Previous versions of Initial Setup would run the first time a user logs in
  ("existing user" mode) as well as when the system is booted with no users
  ("new user" mode). Initial Setup no longer displays any UI in "existing user"
  mode, to avoid colliding with the tour. The mode has not been removed in code
  ‚Äì a simple check has been added to the main() function. If your distribution
  needs the old behaviour, this check can be patched out. The hope is that a
  future version of GNOME will restore "existing user" mode, but run Initial
  Setup from the same cut-down Shell that is used in "new user" mode. (#120)

* Initial Setup's .desktop file is now installed to @datadir@/applications
  (i.e. /usr/share/applications) rather than a GDM-specific directory. This
  means its icon is displayed correctly when run within a normal shell session.
  Some distros have previously worked around this issue by installing a
  symbolic link. (The astute reader may note that this is a no-op given the
  previous bullet point, but it is still a nice clean-up.) (#52)

  (#112) but the new behaviour is better than the old.

* Use `gnome-tour` instead of `yelp` to start the welcome tour. (MR !90.)

* Switch to a new user session management approach of defining the session
  services in `gnome-session@gnome-initial-setup.target.d/session.conf` in the
  systemd user unit directory. This bumps the optional systemd dependency
  to ‚â• 242. See !66 for more details.

3.37.3
------

* The avatars offered in the 'account' page can now be customized by setting
  the 'org.gnome.desktop.interface avatar-directories' GSetting, which also
  controls the avatars offered in Settings. (This introduces a dependency on
  gsettings-desktop-schemas ‚â• 3.37.1.)

* Since version 3.30, it has been possible to customize certain aspects of
  Initial Setup by specifing the 'vendor-conf-file' option at build time, then
  installing a configuration file to that path. This version adds two paths
  that will be checked by default: one for distribution configuration, and
  another to override that configuration on specific deployments.

  If you specify the 'vendor-conf-file' at build time, the old behaviour is
  preserved and the new paths will not be searched. If possible, please migrate
  any existing configuration to the new path, and stop specifying the
  build-time option.

* Bugs fixed:
  - #106 timezone: Don't set timezone if tz page is skipped
 - #75 Polkit rules seem to list now unneeded privileges
 - #95 Add error argument to save_data() vfunc
 - #104 Japanese (Kana Kanji) no longer the default input method for Japanese in 3.36.2

3.35.91
-------

* New pages have been added to set up parental controls for the new user
  account. They are shown (or not, by default) based on a checkbox on the
  (local) user creation page. This feature requires malcontent ‚â• 0.5.0
  <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pwithnall/malcontent/> and complements
  parental controls support already present in Flatpak and GNOME Software. If
  disabled or if that dependency is not available, no new UI is introduced
  compared to 3.35.90.

* When running under JHBuild, gnome-keyring is left untouched, and state is not
  saved when setup is complete. This heuristic is intended to make testing the
  application during development easier.

* GLib ‚â• 2.63.1 is now required.

* Fixed various memory leaks, warnings, and a memory safety bug.

0.2
===

 * Add a language selector to replace the Welcome splash screen
   before.
 * GDM integration has been rewritten to use libgdm instead of
   libgdmuser.
 * A lot of code has been properly split out into static
   libraries; each page now has one static library. In the
   future, we will have an unsupported module API that can be
   used to extend the system.
 * Use a cc-notebook, stolen from gnome-control-center, that
   allows smooth animations between pages. A plain GTK+
   implementation is being written for systems without the
   capabilities to run animations.
 * Complete integration by including a copy worker run on session
   init. This strategy should work for the use case of enterprise
   users.
 * Fix libcheese integration, and disallow the file picker when
   choosing a user icon.
